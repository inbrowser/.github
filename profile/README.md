# Hi there, weâ€™re InBrowser :wave:

We are a small team of developers working on open-source tools. We are either

- creating new tools
- providing an interface for existing tools, that is user-friendly

For instance, you will usually look on `[insert your search engine here (ex: Qwant, Google, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, etc.)]` for "PNG to PDF" or some mathematical tools such as "Product of two matrices". Sometimes, everything is working well, and sometimes, you need to log in, disable AdBlock (if you got one), pay something, etc. to see the steps or worse, the result. As we don't like that, our goal is to provide as many tools as we can

- for free (no ads, no register)
- open-source (you can read the code, contribute)
- without a server (your data will never leave your browser)

We are trying to make an initiative, support us by sharing your work if you're enjoying our idea :rocket:!
